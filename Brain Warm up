 As portal wil be used by students  for downloading mostly 1-2 weeks before exam. And very less probably anyone will upload a past paper for that exam. And file uploaded for any other exam do not matter to be zipped or not
So we can create zip files as user uploads some file and delete previous version. And when exam season arrives just keep ready all the zip files stored. 
Also we can keep files like textbooks lectures that wont be changed over the period can be kept as already zipped so that it will reduce time tozip further as zipping a zipped file is less time consuming.
We can display user what are things that yet to be modified in the zip while downloading it. and if the user still demands (genuine request can be verified by multiple requests) it , then we can zip it and update the same.
